## 👋 About Me

I'm a hands-on IT professional with a passion for automation, media servers, and open-source solutions. I work as an IT Help Desk Level 2 technician and manage complex systems involving Proxmox, Docker, and ZFS. I love solving problems, creating custom tools for internal use, and building tech that helps people — like my Raspberry Pi-based offline theater kit.

Currently pursuing the Linux+ certification and looking for opportunities where I can contribute ideas, not just tickets.
